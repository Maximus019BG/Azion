<h1> Mission </h1>
<hr/>

### Our mission is helping *organizations* with their management <br> while protecting their sensitive information and keeping it ***secure***.
<br>

<h1> Features </h1>
<hr/>

### 1. One of the key features is the ***data access***- not everybody can <br> access all the date of the *company*

### 2. *Role*-based management- the boss can assign **work** to different people

### 3. Multi platform app- our app is on *Desktop (Windows 10/11)*, <br> *Mobile (Android)* and we have a *web* version. 

<h1> Security </h1>
<hr/>

### Our *application* doesn't ***only*** have the bas *security* <br>  requirements like *hashing* passwords but some of the more **advanced** one like ***MFA*** with <br> face recognition. And as mentioned we have *role-based data access* so <br> you know who can see your *sensitive **information*** <br> and who can change some of the *data* and roles.
